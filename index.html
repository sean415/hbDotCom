      <p>Hi! I'm Holly. I'm a writer and content strategist.</p>

      <p>I spent five years at Instagram, building and running the writing team. As Instagram's first content strategy manager, I grew our team of writers from two people—one of whom was me—into the double digits. Before that, I was a content strategist at Facebook, a writer at Gowalla, and a writer at Travelocity, where one of my most surreal job duties was acting as the official voice of the Roaming Gnome. On the upside, I got to fly all over the world, writing funny tweets in disguise as someone else. On the downside, I had to walk through airports carrying a large ceramic gnome.</p>

      <p>These days, I split my time between content strategy, journalism, and fiction. My work has been published in <em>The New York Times</em> and I'm currently consulting with clients like Instacart and MatchesTalent. I've written advertorial copy for <em>Travel + Leisure</em>, detailed my DIY kitchen renovation in <em>Ladies' Home Journal</em>, and ghostwritten <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Southern-Weddings-New-Looks-South/dp/0941711935/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=weddings+by+tara+guerard&qid=1590689400&s=books&sr=1-2" target="new">a book</a> for one of the country's top wedding planners.</p>

      <p>I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, but I am a British person with a British accent. I like throwing parties and getting really good deals on things.</p>

      <p>I always think I don't like public speaking, right up until the minute I get up on stage and realize I'm a huge ham. Turns out I actually love being the center of attention! As well as being part of the advisory committee for the 2017 Design Matters conference in Copenhagen, I've spoken at the following conferences:</p>
