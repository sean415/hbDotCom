      <p>I'm a writer, editor, and content strategist. I believe in the power of language and the importance of giving people the right words at the right time. Currently, I work at Instagram, where I manage a team of whipsmart content strategists who work on products like Instagram Stories, Direct, Live, and IGTV.</p>

      <p>Before that, I was a content strategist at Facebook, a writer at Gowalla, and a copywriter and social media manager at Travelocity, where one of my most surreal job duties was acting as the official written voice of the Travelocity Roaming Gnome. On the upside, I got to fly all over the world, writing funny tweets in disguise as someone else. On the downside, I had to walk through airports carrying a very large ceramic gnome.</p>

      <p>I have a background in magazine publishing and have written things that have appeared all over the place, though Ladies Home Journal and Travel + Leisure were the two most exciting ones because my parents had actually heard of them. Back when blogging was a thing, I had a blog called Nothing But Bonfires, and it kept me in fun money for a little while. I got a free stove out of it, a couple of jobs, a few trips, and some nice friends. I hung up my hat in 2014 because it just wasn't fun anymore, but I kept the friends. (Also the stove. I totally kept the free stove.)</p>

      <p>In November 2017, when my second child was 5 months old, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I went through chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. I'm currently cancer-free and hoping this was just a terrible blip in an otherwise pretty wonderful existence. I grew up in England, France, Holland, Abu Dhabi, Singapore, Hong Kong, and the slightly less glamorous Connecticut, and I currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my husband and children. I like throwing parties, planning vacations, and getting really good deals on things. I am the author of exactly no books but my biggest goal in life is to change that one day.</p>

      <p>I always think I don't like public speaking, right up until the minute I get up on stage and realize I'm a huge ham. Turns out I actually love being the center of attention! As well as being part of the advisory committee for the 2017 Design Matters conference in Copenhagen, I've spoken at the following conferences:</p>
